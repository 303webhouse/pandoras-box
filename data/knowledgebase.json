      "shortDescription": "The Savita Indicator is based on Bank of America's Sell Side Indicator (SSI), which tracks Wall Street strategists' recommended equity allocation. Named after BofA's lead strategist Savita Subramanian, this contrarian indicator measures average recommended stock allocation by sell-side strategists.\n\nWhen strategists become overly bullish (high equity allocation), it historically signals caution. When they become overly bearish (low equity allocation), it often signals buying opportunities. The indicator operates on the principle that consensus Wall Street sentiment tends to be wrong at extremes.\n\nThe system categorizes readings as: BULLISH (strategists are bearish, contrarian buy signal), BEARISH (strategists are bullish, contrarian sell signal), or NEUTRAL (no extreme reading).\n\nThis is a cyclical/long-term bias indicator that changes infrequently, typically updated monthly when BofA releases new data.",
      "fullDescription": "The Savita Indicator is a contrarian sentiment measure based on Bank of America's Sell Side Indicator (SSI). It tracks the average recommended equity allocation among Wall Street sell-side strategists.\n\n## How It Works\n\nBank of America surveys major Wall Street firms monthly to determine their recommended portfolio allocation to equities. When this collective recommendation reaches extreme levels, it historically signals the opposite market direction:\n\n- **High Equity Allocation (>55%)**: Strategists are overly bullish → Contrarian BEARISH signal\n- **Low Equity Allocation (<45%)**: Strategists are overly bearish → Contrarian BULLISH signal\n- **Middle Range (45-55%)**: No extreme → NEUTRAL\n\n## Historical Performance\n\nAccording to BofA research, when the indicator has been in the \"buy\" zone (low allocation), subsequent 12-month S&P 500 returns have averaged +15%. When in the \"sell\" zone (high allocation), subsequent returns have been significantly lower or negative.\n\n## Why It's Contrarian\n\nSell-side strategists tend to become most bullish near market tops (after prices have already risen) and most bearish near market bottoms (after prices have already fallen). This behavioral pattern makes their consensus a useful contrary indicator.\n\n## Usage in the Trading Hub\n\nThe Savita Indicator contributes to the Cyclical Bias calculation, influencing the long-term market outlook. It's weighted alongside other cyclical factors like the yield curve, long-term credit spreads, and the SAHM Rule.\n\n## Data Source\n\nUpdated monthly from Bank of America Global Research reports. The user is prompted to manually update this value when new data is released.\n\n## Related Concepts\n\n- Cyclical Bias\n- Contrarian Indicators\n- Sentiment Analysis",

      "shortDescription": "The Dollar Smile theory explains how the US Dollar behaves in different market environments. The 'smile' shape comes from plotting dollar strength against economic conditions: the dollar is strong at both extremes (crisis/risk-off AND strong US growth) but weak in the middle (global growth/risk-on).\n\nIn this system, the Dollar Smile indicator combines DXY (Dollar Index) trend with VIX levels to determine the current regime:\n\n- **Risk-Off (Left side of smile)**: Dollar rising + VIX elevated = Flight to safety, bearish for risk assets\n- **Risk-On (Bottom of smile)**: Dollar falling + VIX normal = Global growth, bullish for risk assets\n- **US Outperformance (Right side of smile)**: Dollar rising + VIX normal = US economy strong, selective bullish\n\nThis indicator helps determine whether current conditions favor risk-taking or risk-aversion.",

US Outperformance (Right Side of Smile)\n- **Dollar**: Strong and rising\n- **VIX**: Normal (<20)\n- **Interpretation**: US economy outpacing rest of world; dollar strength from growth, not fear\n- **Trading Implication**: Selectively BULLISH for US assets\n\n## Implementation Details\n\nThe system calculates:\n1. **DXY Trend**: 20-day vs 50-day SMA crossover\n2. **VIX Level**: Current VIX relative to historical norms\n3. **Combined Signal**: Matrix of dollar trend + volatility regime\n\n## Signal Logic\n\n| DXY Trend | VIX Level | Regime | Bias |\n|-----------|-----------|--------|------|\n| Rising | High (>20) | Risk-Off | BEARISH |\n| Falling | Low (<20) | Risk-On | BULLISH |\n| Rising | Low (<20) | US Outperform | NEUTRAL/BULLISH |\n| Falling | High (>20) | Transition | NEUTRAL |\n\n## TradingView Integration\n\nThis indicator can receive signals via TradingView webhooks, allowing real-time regime detection based on chart data.\n\n## Related Concepts\n\n- Weekly Bias\n- DXY (Dollar Index)\n- VIX\n- Risk-On/Risk-Off",

      "shortDescription": "The Hybrid Scanner combines technical analysis with fundamental data to find trade candidates that pass both screens.\n\n**Technical Engine** (via TradingView):\n- Trend direction and strength\n- Momentum indicators (RSI, MACD)\n- Moving average positions\n- Volume analysis\n\n**Fundamental Engine** (via yfinance):\n- Analyst consensus ratings\n- Price targets and upside\n- Recent rating changes\n- Market cap classification\n\nSetups must align technically AND fundamentally, reducing false signals from either approach alone.",
