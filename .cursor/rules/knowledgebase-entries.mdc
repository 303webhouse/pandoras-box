  "shortDescription": "Max 500 words. Brief explanation for popup display. Include key points, how it works, and trading implications.",
  "fullDescription": "Complete detailed explanation with markdown formatting. Include sections for: What it is, How it works, Trading implications, Related concepts.",
  "relatedTerms": ["related-term-id-1", "related-term-id-2"]
}
```

### 2. Short Description Requirements (for popup)

- Maximum 500 words
- Must explain what the term means
- Must explain how it's used in trading
- Should include key signals or interpretations

### 3. Full Description Requirements (for full page)

- Include sections:
  - Definition/Overview
  - How It Works (calculation if applicable)
  - Interpretation/Signal Logic
  - Trading Implications

### 4. Category Selection

Choose the most appropriate category:

| Category | Use For |

| Trading Concepts | General trading terminology |
| Options Flow | Options and flow-related terms |
| Time Frames | Time-related concepts |

### 5. Related Terms

Always link to related knowledgebase entries by their ID. This improves navigation and helps users understand connections between concepts.

## Example Entry

```json
{
  "id": "new-indicator-name",
  "term": "New Indicator Name",
  "category": "Bias Indicators",
  "shortDescription": "Brief 500-word max description explaining the indicator, how it works, and what signals it generates.\n\nInclude key interpretation points:\n- Bullish signal: Condition X\n- Bearish signal: Condition Y\n- Neutral: Condition Z\n\nExplain why this indicator matters for trading decisions.",
  "fullDescription": "## Overview\n\nFull detailed explanation...\n\n## How It Works\n\nTechnical details...\n\n## Signal Interpretation\n\n| Signal | Condition | Action |\n|--------|-----------|--------|\n| Bullish | X > Y | Consider longs |\n\n## Related Concepts\n\n- Related concept 1\n- Related concept 2",
  "relatedTerms": ["related-term-1", "related-term-2"]
}
```

## Verification

After adding a new entry:

1. Verify the JSON is valid (no syntax errors)
2. Check that the ID is unique
3. Ensure the category matches an existing category
4. Test that related term IDs exist in the knowledgebase
5. Reload the knowledgebase cache via API: `POST /api/knowledgebase/reload`

## Reminder

This knowledgebase serves as the single source of truth for all trading terminology in the application. Keeping it updated ensures users can always understand any term they encounter in the UI.
