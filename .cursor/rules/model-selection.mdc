# Model Selection

## Default Behavior

Use **faster models** for most tasks. Only use **Opus** when the request genuinely benefits from its additional capabilities.

## When to Use Opus

- Complex architectural decisions or major refactors
- Debugging subtle or multi-layered issues
- Tasks requiring deep reasoning across many files
- Novel problems without clear patterns

## When Faster Models Suffice

- Simple file edits and bug fixes
- Adding features with clear patterns
- Standard CRUD operations
- Running commands and deployments
- Repetitive or well-defined tasks

## Required: Announce Model at Start

At the beginning of every build/task response, state which model tier is being used:

```
**Model: Faster** - [brief reason]
```
or
```
**Model: Opus** - [brief reason why Opus is needed]
```

This helps the user understand resource allocation and allows them to redirect if needed.
